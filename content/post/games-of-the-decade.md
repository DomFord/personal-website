# My Games of the Decade

With everyone and their mother writing games of the year or games of the decade lists at the moment, I’m well aware that the last thing people want is my opinion on the matter. But I write this more as an exercise for myself. And, to be fair, the end of a decade is a biggie.

I want to explore which games have resonated most with me over the past ten years or so. In that, I hope I can also see some blind spots that I can look to rectify during the 20s. I am well aware that I am biased as a player and as a human. I might find that I have played a disappointing number of games made by or with marginalised people, or by people outside of my Anglosphere cultural environment.

This list is an opportunity for me to reflect on the impact that games have had on me over a decade in which I have grown enormously. In 2010, I was around 16 years old. I was entering Sixth Form to study for my A-Levels. I was yet to know what I wanted to study at university, or which university I wanted to go to. (I did, however, know that I wanted to go to university.) To think that now, by the end of the 10s, I am writing this in my office in Copenhagen, researching videogames for a living and working towards a PhD, is mindboggling.

Let’s see what I’ve played.

## *Dark Souls* (FromSoftware, 2011)

Anyone who knows me will be entirely unsurprised by this choice. *Dark Souls* has featured as a key game in my bachelor’s thesis and both my master’s theses, and is highly likely to feature in my PhD thesis. For me, it stands as the greatest game ever made.

I heard about it a year or two after it was released—certainly after its expansion, *Artorias of the Abyss* (FromSoftware, 2012), had come out—and thought it sounded like a cool, if generic, roleplaying game. Instead, its world resonated with me like no other had before. The reason why I write about *Dark Souls* so often is because I never feel like I have said all I need to say on it. I never feel like I have gotten to the essence of why the game resonates with me so strongly.

Eric Kain writing for *Forbes* says that the game’s story has an “archaeological” quality to it (2012), and that’s a description that’s stuck with me. And it’s the way that world ties in so elegantly with the mechanics. I’ll leave it there before I go on for too long. Suffice it to say, I’m not done figuring this game out yet.
