Very late to the party, I recently bought a PlayStation 4 which came with three of the PS4 games I most wanted to play: *God of War* (SIE Santa Monica Studio, 2018), *The Last of Us Remastered* (Sony Computer Entertainment, 2014) and *Horizon Zero Dawn* (Guerrilla Games, 2017).

The first of these I picked to play was *Horizon Zero Dawn*. It does a lot of the things I'm interested in at the moment and I'd looked into bits of the game before. For example, I knew of the Old Ones in the game, following [a trope I'm interested in](https://domford.me/publication/ford-lost-2018/) of the 'long-lost, ancient civilisation with technology far exceeding the present day'. It also deals with the prescient issue of ecology. Plus the game just has a pretty great premise, and came with glowing recommendations from friends and colleagues.

I'm glad I played this in 2020 and not late last year, else it'd have made my [games of the decade list](https://domford.me/post/games-of-the-decade/) even more difficult to compile.
